Run database.php from the command line

Description: Simple Database

Your task is create a very simple in-memory database, which has a very limited command set. All of the commands are going to be fed to you one line at a time via stdin, and your job is the process the commands and perform whatever operation the command dictates. Here are the basic commands you need to handle:

SET [name] [value]: Set a variable [name] to the value [value]. Neither variable names or values will ever contain spaces.
GET [name]: Print out the value stored under the variable [name]. Print NULL if that variable name hasn't been set.
UNSET [name]: Unset the variable [name]
NUMEQUALTO [value]: Return the number of variables equal to [value]. If no values are equal, this should output 0.
END: Exit the program
BEGIN: Open a transactional block
ROLLBACK: Rollback all of the commands from the most recent transaction block. If no transactional block is open, print out INVALID ROLLBACK
COMMIT: Permanently store all of the operations from any presently open transactional blocks
