Run database.php from the command line

Description: Simple Database

Your task is create a very simple in-memory database, which has a very limited command set. All of the commands are going to be fed to you one line at a time via stdin, and your job is the process the commands and perform whatever operation the command dictates. Here are the basic commands you need to handle:

SET [name] [value]: Set a variable [name] to the value [value]. Neither variable names or values will ever contain spaces.
GET [name]: Print out the value stored under the variable [name]. Print NULL if that variable name hasn't been set.
UNSET [name]: Unset the variable [name]
NUMEQUALTO [value]: Return the number of variables equal to [value]. If no values are equal, this should output 0.
END: Exit the program
BEGIN: Open a transactional block
ROLLBACK: Rollback all of the commands from the most recent transaction block. If no transactional block is open, print out INVALID ROLLBACK
COMMIT: Permanently store all of the operations from any presently open transactional blocks
Our database supports nested transactional blocks as you can tell by the above commands. Remember, ROLLBACK only rolls back the most recent transaction block, while COMMIT closes all open transactional blocks. Any command issued outside of a transactional block commits automatically.
